Geogram is a programming library with geometric algorithms. It
contains the main results in Geometry Processing from the former ALICE
Inria project, that is, more than
[30 research articles](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/geogram/wiki/Publications) published in
ACM SIGGRAPH, ACM Transactions on Graphics, Symposium on Geometry
Processing and Eurographics. It was supported by two grants from the
European Research Council (ERC): GOODSHAPE and VORPALINE.

Geogram includes a simple yet efficient Mesh data structure (for
surfacic and volumetric meshes), exact computer arithmetics (a-la
Shewchuck, implemented in GEO::expansion ), a predicate code generator
(PCK: the Predicate Construction Kit), standard geometric predicates
(orient/insphere), Delaunay triangulation, Voronoi diagram, spatial
search data structures, spatial sorting) and less standard ones (more
general geometric predicates, intersection between a Voronoi diagram
and a triangular or tetrahedral mesh embedded in n dimensions), and
semi-discrete optimal transport.
