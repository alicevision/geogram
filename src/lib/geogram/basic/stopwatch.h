     * SystemStopwatch provides functions to get or print the time
     * elapsed since its construction. The times computed by
     * SystemStopwatch are expressed as system ticks, which is a system
     * dependent unit. SystemStopwatch prints three different times:
     *
     * - real time: the really elapsed time (depends on the load of the
     *   machine, i.e. on the others programs that are executed at the
     *   same time).
     * - system time: the time spent in system calls.
     * - user time: the time really spent in the process.
     *
     * Example:
     * \code
     * {
     *     SystemStopwatch clock ;
     *     do_something() ;
     *     clock.print_elapsed_time(std::cout) ;
